    "- To calculate the prevalence of various comorbidities in the ASD cohort, we first had to develop a mapping table using the ACT Ontology v2.0.1, which contained ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 108,024 distinct ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were mapped to ACT terms aggregated in levels using Microsoft Excel. The LEN function, which is built into Excel, was used to construct the following formula:\n",
    "    **=LEN(A3)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A3,\"\\\",\"\"))**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When applied to the input table, this formula transformed the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes into a table organized from Level 0 (the most general category) to Level 9 (the deepest category). ICD-10 codes were organized up to category n, while ICD-9 codes were organized up to category n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transformed table was then uploaded into the SQL server and named ACT_ICD10_ICD9_3. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To retrieve comorbidities associated with each individual in the ASD cohort and join the ASD cohort with the ACT Ontology mapping table, the ASDMembers, FactICD, and ACT_codes all had to be joined. Since this mapping process was time-intensive, it was performed separately for each level of the mapping table."
